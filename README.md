# WARNING
## this will probably void your phone's Warranty and i will not take any responsibility for breaking your phone use it at your own risk

1. First enable developer option and usb debugging and install via usb [Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
2. you should have Android SDK Platforms Tools on your system and added to your path environment variables [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)  [Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
3. Download Empty_Script.bat from repo
4. put package name of the apps you want to uninstall in list (you can add multiple packages at once just separate them with space) e.g. <code>list=com.xiaomi.mipicks com.miui.msa.global com.miui.cloudservice</code>
5. finally save and run the script and let the magic happen ;)

I additionally have provided a script with all the MIUI 11 default apps that i personally don't use you can check that out and if there is any app that you dont want to be uninstalled just remove from the list

this project is inspired by [Windows10Debloater
